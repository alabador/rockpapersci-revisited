# Rock, Paper, Scissors

For this project, I created a Rock, Paper Scissors game as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

Initially, this game was only playable through the console, but I later reworked it to be playable through a user interface.

To finish this project, it took me around ~20 hours combining part 1 and 2. The time gap between each part was around 9ish months since I had written the original logic for this. 

A good portion of the time was spent trying to rework and refactor the code from working only on the console, into working with the DOM and events.
